First of all select file from your PC then you see content of text file on web interface. Only text file is allowed. Then have 2 buttons encrypt and decrypt that convert data of given text file into encrypted or decrypted form. After click on encrypt or decrypt you see converted data on web interface. Then you enter file name in given input field and click download button to save encrypted or decrypted data of your given text file in your PC.
